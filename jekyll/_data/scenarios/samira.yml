paragraphs:
  - "Samira is a mother who just relocated to a new city to leave an abusive and highly dangerous partner. She’s left everything behind and does not want him to be able to find her. She is trying to start over with very little. She’s currently living in an emergency DV shelter. She’s been receiving basic services (shelter, counseling, basic legal advocacy, etc.) through the shelter, but she needs to transition out soon since there is a limit to how long she can stay at the shelter."
  - "Samira needs to find affordable housing and a job. She’s doesn’t have a lot of work experience, but she’s temped in offices before. She doesn’t have a car, so she needs a job that’s either walking distance or that she can get to with public transportation. Although she has custody of her child, there are still ongoing court hearings, and so she needs to be able to travel to the court house for hearings."
  - "She needs to find a home for her and her daughter. She’d like a place that’s safe but close enough to her job and close to her daughter’s elementary school.  She will also need to find affordable afterschool care for her daughter while she is at work. Also, her daughter has type 1 diabetes and needs to regularly visit the doctor, so she wants to know where the nearest free clinic or emergency clinic is in case there are complications."
  - "Because she’s in a new area and doesn’t know anyone, except the people at the shelter, she needs to know where everything is, including grocery stores, laundromats, post office, etc. It would be great to know where the nearest police or sheriff’s department is so she can take her protection order to them to have on file.  She also is interested in finding a faith-based or culturally-specific community she might be able to connect to in order to rebuild her support system and meet people."
