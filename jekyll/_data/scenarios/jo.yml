  - "Jo is a 19 year old transgender woman, born and raised in a small town in Idaho. Throughout her life, Jo’s family experiences housing instability, causing her to change schools often and have a difficult time making friends and maintaining close relationships. With a lot of time spent on her own, Jo takes solace in drawing and creating art at an early age. During her senior year of high school, Jo comes out as transgender to her classmate Mariah, who accepts and affirms her for who she is. The chance to be open with someone about her gender identity is a huge relief to Jo, and the two become close friends."
  - "After graduation, Mariah suggests they move to Cincinnati together, where they can stay with her cousin for a small fee. Cincinnati offers more transition-related resources for Jo, and it’s much easier to get around in the city (Jo doesn’t have a car). Also, Mariah’s cousin owns a hair salon and says they can help out from time to time to make a bit of money. The two decide to make the move."
  - "After a few weeks of doing temp work and trying to make ends meet in the city, Jo lands a job interview for a receptionist position at a local arts magazine. However, the night before the interview, Mariah gets into a bad fight with her cousin, who tells Jo and Mariah that they are no longer welcome in her home. Jo and Mariah call the few people they’ve met in the city to see if they can crash on someone’s couch, but no one is able to offer them a place to stay. One person, however, gives them the address to a local youth shelter."
  - "While going through intake at the shelter, Jo is informed that shelter policy requires she be housed in the men’s wing because her government I.D. says “male,” while Mariah, who is cisgender, is placed in the women’s wing. Jo asks if an exception can be made so she can be placed in the women’s wing with Mariah. The caseworker explains that she wants to help, but she is limited by strict institutional policies. If Jo wants to stay at the shelter, she needs to stay in the men’s wing."
  - "Separated from her friend, and feeling unsafe due to the sex-segregated housing policy, Jo decides she’s going to find another place to stay. She explains to the caseworker that, in addition to housing, she also needs to prepare for an important interview in the morning. Jo still needs to do some more research on the company, find a safe place to get changed before the interview, and figure out how to get there. She doesn’t have a lot of cash, she’s unfamiliar with the city, and her phone battery is dying. Also, Jo is low on mobile data, so she’s unable to access information without WiFi."
  - "If Jo had an app designed for her needs…"
  - "The caseworker suggests Jo download the True Connect mobile app, which will connect her to transgender-affirming housing and other resources that can help her prepare for the interview. Jo uses the shelter WiFi to download the app and finds a safe place to stay for the night."
  - "The next morning, Jo uses True Connect to locate an affordable healthy corner store to get some breakfast, a charging station to finish charging her phone, and a free wifi hotspot so she can do a bit more research on the magazine company before her interview. Through the app, she locates a gender-neutral restroom near the magazine company where she can get ready and a free shuttle bus that will take her close to where she needs to go. Jo notices the app also includes a list of transgender-affirming health care providers, which she plans to explore later. Before the interview, Jo uses True Connect to find a public park near the magazine company where she can decompress and relax."
  - "Thanks to the True Colors Fund for creating this scenario highlighting the True Connect app concept."
