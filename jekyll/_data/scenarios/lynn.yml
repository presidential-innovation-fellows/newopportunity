paragraphs:
  - "Lynn is a 35 year old mother of 3 who has had a Section 8 voucher for the last year. She and her kids live in an apartment in a low-income neighborhood.  After going out for errands with a friend out in the suburbs a few months ago, she has since been extremely committed to finding a new place for her kids to live that has green space and trees, which she had never even thought was an option before.  She found out that she could use her voucher in the suburbs too.  The neighborhood where she lives now has no parks and nowhere for her kids to play sports, even though they love it.  Their schools had to cut a lot of their athletic programs. She wishes she lived closer to a supermarket that had good fruits and vegetables and more options for her kids to try so they can develop good eating habits.  She doesn’t like having to give them junk food which seems to be everywhere at her supermarket."
  - "Lynn works as a receptionist in an outpatient facility at a hospital and doesn’t have a car; she relies on public transit or for her sister to drive her and the kids when she can.  Lynn is excited to start looking for a new place, but worries about how to get around without a car, because it seems like you have to drive in the suburbs, and she’s not sure the buses even go there. She’s worried it might be tough for her kids to transition schools."
  - "Lynn is able to get a ride out one day to look at places in one of the towns that her sister has been to, which is an hour away from her apartment.  They look in newspapers and go on craigslist every day for two weeks and find a couple of places.  She goes to one, who won’t take section 8.  She’s probably already spent $80 on application fees, only to be rejected.  The day is running out, and she decides to go ahead with the 3rd one she sees. She is so relieved when the landlord at the third place tells her that she takes vouchers, she signs up on the spot. If she doesn’t like it, she can always move in a year. This is the only day she has to look, and even though she doesn’t really know a lot about the area, it has grass and trees and big rooms for her kids, so she’s happy. The landlord tells her the schools are good. She still worries she doesn’t know enough about the schools and how she’ll get around."
