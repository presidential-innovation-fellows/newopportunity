description: "Military spouse searching for jobs after moving"
paragraphs:
  - "Jen is a 35 year old professional, mother of two young kids, and for the last ten years she has been married to Kyle, a Staff Sergeant in the United States Army. Jen is proud of the support she provides her husband as a military spouse, but she has often found it difficult to maintain her own professional identity due to the mobile lifestyle that military service leads to. The family has recently learned that Kyle has been reassigned to a different installation and they will have to pack up, sell their house, and relocate their family in the matter of a few weeks."
  - "For the last five years, Jen and Kyle have lived in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Kyle is stationed at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville while Jen commutes more than a two-hour round trip to Raleigh, North Carolina to work at her job as a registered nurse. While Jen thinks of herself as a mother and wife, she is proud of her career and loves helping others. At her job, Jen has become a valued member of a number of specialized nursing teams. If Kyle were to continue to be stationed at Ft. Bragg, Jen could see herself building upon the nursing skills she’s acquired and pursuing further education. Jen’s career success has not been easy. During their ten year marriage, Kyle and Jen have moved across state lines three times, once being to Germany.  Each time they move, they must move out of and into a new house, find child care for their two young kids and assimilate into a new community. This has resulted in Jen having to put her career on hold several times; the end result being that Jen has not been able to progress in her career and has often had to start over at new locations."
  - "In the last week, Jen has been extremely anxious and fearful because of Kyle’s impending reassignment to Fort Benning near Columbus, Georgia. Because of Kyle’s job, the responsibilities of the pending move have fallen to Jen.  She has had to take multiple days of leave to take care of the logistics of moving – selling the house, finding child care for the kids, and thinking about what this move means for her career. Jen knows next to nothing about Columbus beyond what Google and Wikipedia tell her. From what she can tell, there do not appear to be many, if any, hospitals in the area that specialize in the sort of skills she has developed. Moreover, she’s not sure how state licensing issues will affect her ability to find work."
  - "Jen wants to begin sending out resumes and doing more research, but she just doesn’t have the time. Jen is planning on resigning from her current job in the next few days, and she’s afraid that this move will mean that she has to put her career on hold again. Jen knows the statistics: military spouses face a 25 percent unemployment rate and a 25 percent wage gap compared to their civilian counterparts."
  - "Jen tries her best to figure out whether there’s a job she would enjoy and is qualified for in Columbus. She finds a number of job websites with job postings that appear interesting, but they either require a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree or have job titles that make it unclear whether her skills would be a good fit. As Jen begins to develop her resume, she wishes that there was a common language that would make translating her skills and experiences easier.  She knows that she is qualified for a number of positions but is worried that her resume will not stack up against others."
