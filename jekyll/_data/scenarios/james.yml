  - "James is a semi-retired real estate agent who lives in the Fairmont Park neighborhood. The park is located on a major thoroughfare, with a busy bus transfer point along one side. This summer the bus stop was plagued by night-time armed robberies committed by teenagers, and now everyone is on edge. Some people say that the broken streetlights surrounding the park are partially to blame."
  - "The park takes up a full city block has no amenities, except a small corner with aging play equipment made out of metal too hot for kids to play on in the summertime. There are nice playgrounds at nearby private schools, but those aren’t open to the community. James has talked to the City’s Parks & Rec department, and they don’t have funds to install new playgrounds. They barely have enough resources, they said, to keep the grass mowed."
  - "James’s wife works for a nonprofit agency, and recently saw a grant competition for new playgrounds. James thinks Fairmont Park has a shot at getting a grant, especially if they partner with the neighborhood across the street, Oakwood. Between these adjacent neighborhoods there are lots of kids – even more kids who would use the playground if you count those children waiting with their parents at the bus stop!"
  - "James knows from living in the neighborhood a long time that the Fairmont Park neighborhood is middle income and racially and ethnically diverse, and Oakwood neighborhood is home to low income, mostly African American families. He reaches out to Ronald, a neighborhood leader in Oakwood he knows from last year’s community planning meetings that were part of the city’s new Master Plan."
  - "They decide to split up the work writing the grant proposal. James’ experience in real estate has taught him how important location is, and Ronald, whose day job is a public school PE teacher, has some specific ideas about features for the play equipment. He and Ronald would like to include a map in the grant proposal that shows how central Fairmont Park is for commuters, and children without access to other places to play. And they want to highlight how the park could bring together these two neighborhoods. They are so excited about the idea of turning Fairmont Park around, that they’re even talking about what they’ll do once the playground gets installed: they’ll approach the city about getting those streetlights repaired, and maybe a monthly arts market, too. James takes a screen shot of Google maps, and draws arrows and boxes on it in Powerpoint, and they include it in the appendix of the grant proposal."
