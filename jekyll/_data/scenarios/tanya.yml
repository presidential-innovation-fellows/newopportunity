description: "Section 8 voucher holder/low-income renter searching for housing"
paragraphs:
  - "Tanya is a 25-year-old mother of 6-year-old and 4-year-old boys. She just received a Section 8 voucher after 2 years on the waiting list.  She’s been living in several different places over the last few years.  After she turned 18 and had a baby, she wanted a household of her own and rented a unit in a building where her cousin had a place, but lost her job when she her childcare became unreliable (her boyfriend’s mom couldn’t help as much as she had promised), then lived with her sister and then in public housing.  Her voucher means to her that she’ll be able to have a nicer place of her own with her kids.  She wants them to live in a safer building where they can have quiet after school to do their homework as they get older.  She doesn’t like the crime in the neighborhood where she is now, but she can keep her sons inside and there is at least someone she knows in the area to watch them when she really needs it."
  - "Tanya works and takes care of her kids on her own so she doesn’t have a lot of time to look for a place.  She doesn’t have a car and gets around mostly on the bus or by walking.  Since last year, her youngest has been with an older neighbor during the day who runs a daycare from her home."
  - "The worst thing for her would be to lose the voucher, and she knows from hearing from other people that it’s not easy to get a place.  You have only 2 months, and some of the landlords won’t take you once they know you have Section 8.  There’s a certain amount she can spend and she gets 2 bedrooms for her and her 2 little boys.  She can’t spend more than the specific amount.  She is actually not totally clear on the process and the people who are supposed to answer questions aren’t very friendly."
  - "Tanya starts calling landlords and the first 6 units either don’t take voucher holders or are too expensive.  She looked on the website GoSection8 and found more places that took her voucher, but didn’t have as much luck finding a place she liked. Tanya is getting nervous about running out of time, and she has a friend who used a Section 8 voucher in a building just a few blocks away from where she’s living now, so she’s planning to go to the same landlord.  It’s safer and cleaner than where she is now and she hopes they will take her voucher."
