          <em>Barb is the Vice President of Riverside Neighborhood Association</em>. Barb’s neighborhood is isolated by rail road tracks and light-industrial business, dotted with empty warehouses. It feels like she’s been fighting for her neighborhood’s survival for years now. Whether proposed high rise apartments that would hamper access to the riverfront, or the opening of yet another bar or liquor store, her neighborhood association seems to always be reacting to something.

Barb has a job as an administrative assistant working for the state in the neighboring county. She feels lucky to have her old car. If traffic is good, it’s a 30 minute drive to her office. But, when the transmission went out last month, she relied on public transportation -- a nearly two-hour bus ride with a transfer at the county line. On her breaks at work, she conducts internet research for the neighborhood association, and she considers neighborhood advocacy to be her “real work.”

Barb’s mother Jean lives with her. Ms. Jean’s diabetes is getting worse, and Barb has been taking time off work to get her to doctors’ appointments halfway across town. The doctor has given them pamphlets on what foods are good for people with diabetes, but her mom prefers the food she’s always cooked, and fresh fruits and vegetables are hard to come by in the neighborhood. The corner store carries a limited selection of produce, but it always seems to be better fit for the trash than a plate.

Many of Barb’s neighbors work two or more jobs in the service industry, which is primarily low-paying, shift work. She wishes there were “good jobs” closer to home, and feels like government and private developers have passed her neighborhood by. On her way to work, Barb sees new businesses popping up in the suburbs. She’d like to see new businesses in her neighborhood. She’s noticed that many of her neighbors have entrepreneurial spirit – whether it be selling homemade lunch plates, or opening music recording studios in their homes.

Barb and her neighbors have heard that the city is launching a new low-interest loan program for organizations willing to bring healthy food to areas like hers. She’d like her neighborhood association to make the case for a location in Riverside–maybe even turning one of those abandoned warehouses into a full service grocery store. She feels at a disadvantage because other neighborhoods have paid professionals making their proposals, and hopes she can find something on the internet to help level the playing field. She does her best during her lunchtime research, but the web sites she finds are tricky to use, and she blames herself for not being good with computers. She pulls together a few statistics, but there’s not enough time to pull together a full proposal for this round, so they let it go.</p>
