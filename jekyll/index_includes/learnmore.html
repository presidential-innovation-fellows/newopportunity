    <p>The President launched the Opportunity Project in March 2016 to catalyze the creation of new digital tools that use federal and local data to empower communities with information about critical resources, such as affordable housing, quality schools, and jobs. By providing easy access to curated federal and local datasets at opportunity.census.gov, and facilitating collaboration between technologists, issue experts, and community leaders, the Opportunity Project is transforming government data into digital tools that create more just and equitable communities and help people solve problems in their everyday lives.</p>

 

    <p>Since its inception, the Opportunity Project has yielded dozens of new digital tools that help meet needs in communities like finding affordable housing near jobs and transportation, advocating for broader access to opportunity in neighborhoods, and making data-driven investments to increase economic mobility.</p>

 

    <p>Through the Opportunity Project, technologists, local governments, and community groups across the country are answering the Presidentâ€™s call to harness 21st century technology and innovation to expand access to opportunity for all Americans.</p>
